# Getting Started

## Installing Eclipse

Regardless of whether you use the Oomph installer or the full download, you
want to install the "Eclipse DSL Tools" product. This includes the Plug-in
Development Tools (PDT) and Xtext features used by this project.

## Building in Eclipse

Most of the plug-in's code is generated by Xtext. When you first open the 
project, you'll need to generate this code manually.

  * Go to **Preferences | Plug-in Development | Target Platform** and select 
    `software.amazon.ionxtext.target`.
  * From the `software.amazon.ionxtext` subproject (not the parent project), 
    browse to `src/software/amazon/ionxtext`. Select `GenerateIon.mwe2` and 
    **Run As | MWE2 Workflow**.
  * You may need to clean all projects to eliminate errors.

You'll also need to do this when you modify various core resources such as the 
grammar definition file `Ion.xtext`.

## Dependency Problems?

If Eclipse is unable to resolve required plugin bundles, you may have a mangled
target platform definition. Go to **Preferences | Plug-in Development | 
Target Platform** and select `software.amazon.ionxtext.target`.

# Developing in Eclipse

## Running the Tests

  * Right-click on the `ionxtext.tests` project and **Run As | JUnit Test**.
  * Recommended to mark the resulting Run Configuration as a favorite for easy
    access at all times.
