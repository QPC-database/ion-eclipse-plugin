== Installing Eclipse ==

Using the Oomph installer...
  * Select the "Eclipse DSL Tools" product.

== Building in Eclipse ==

Most of the plug-in's code is generated by Xtext. When you first open the 
project, you'll need to generate this code manually. You'll also need to do
this when you modify various core resources such as the grammar definition
file `Ion.xtext`.

  * Browse to folder `software.amazon.ionxtext/software/amazon/ionxtext`.
    * Be sure to do this from the `software.amazon.ionxtext` subproject, not
      from the parent project.
  * Select `GenerateIon.mwe2` and **Run As... | MWE2 Workflow**.

== Dependency Problems? ==

If Eclipse is unable to resolve required plugin bundles, you may have a mangled
target platform definition.

See **Preferences | Plug-in Development | Target Platform**.
